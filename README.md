# DUAL-PORT-RAM
The project involves the design and verification of a Dual-Port Random Access Memory (RAM) using SystemVerilog and Universal Verification Methodology (UVM). A Dual-Port RAM allows simultaneous read and write operations through two independent ports (Port A and Port B), enabling higher memory access bandwidth compared to single-port memories.
